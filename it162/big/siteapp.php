<p>Nowadays, a web or a mobile application or both of them are the most essential for almost all
    companies and enterprises except for some local or small businesses. They use it not only to
    advertise their products and brands but also to manage their progress in industry, the revenue,
    and employees. However, neither a responsive website nor a mobile application is the necessary
    tool. Still, you can choose one of them to develop your business if you have a limit on budget or time.

<p>According to the Desktop vs. Mobile vs. Tablet Market Share Worldwide datasheet from Feb.
    2010 to July 2020, we can see that the number of people using a desktop has decreased by
    almost fifty percent. Still, the mobile is increasing fifty percent until recently, and the
    number of users of mobile and desktop is equal. It means that people nowadays prefer to use
    mobile apps rather than desktop since users can search for products or company’s information
    anytime because they always carry their smartphones with them.
</p>
<p>The responsive website is available for all users and friendly with developers. According to
    Viktor Korol, he said that “The site is easy for updating, supporting and bug fixing” since
    users don’t have to download or install new versions to see what has changed on the website.
    Some hosting websites have auto clear cache every thirty-minutes, or the developer will clear
    it manually, so users will automatically see the update of the website.</p>
<p>On the other hand, mobile applications are used more because of its convenience and many features
    that responsive websites don't have. According to the clear bridge mobile website, it shares that
    <cite>"Mobile apps can access and use built-in device features such as the camera, GPS, and location."</cite>
    The mobile applications can access many features of the smartphone. For example, your company can
    send users some special offers, but it differs from each store. Therefore, the ability to use GPS
    and location data can be used to help you know where the area of the users and send the offer to them.</p>

<p>In conclusion, users want to use mobile applications rather than responsive websites since it is
    easy for users to use and convenience. Some mobile apps can work offline and have more interactive
    ways for the user to engage. In my opinion, I prefer to use mobile applications since it is easy to
    use and load the content and function faster than responsive websites.</p>
