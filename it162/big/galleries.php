<p>Nowadays, the gallery is one of the most important parts when we build a website since
it is a tool that helps the company or business to show their products. Besides that,
we can create a gallery slider and use it on the index page. We can use it to show
all the most important information that customers can be known.

https://www.jqueryscript.net/blog/best-carousel.html</a> - “From this website, they recommend
we use the carousel to present the images, products, or blog post since this is the most
popular UI that almost modern web designer used.” According to this website, the carousel
presents the content in an infinite loop. It means the content will start again when it
reaches the end of the content and its difference with the slider is that the slider
usually stops run when we reach the end of the content.</p>

According to https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow_gallery.asp</a> - 
<cite>“The slideshow gallery has been created from HTML, CSS, and JavaSCript. First, we need to 
create a container for the slider. Second, we create a frame to contain an image with a big 
size, and inside the frame, we create a next and previous button. Then, we add text to below 
the image. Finally, we make a row with all images in thumbnail style. After that, we add style 
and javascript to HTML."</cite></p>
<p>In the conclusion, we should have the slider on the website since it is one of the most 
essential parts. It helps businesses to introduce products, images to the customer. Moreover, 
the website can be more flexible if we use the carousel because it will automatically change 
the image as a slideshow, and it will repeat the slide after it reaches the end of the show, 
but the user still can go to the previous or next image by the button.</p>
