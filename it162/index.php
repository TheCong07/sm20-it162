        <p>My name is Cong Ho and I come from Vietnam. I started studying in Seattle in Winter Quarter 2018 and I almost finish my Associate of Computer Science degree in the next Fall Quarter. After finish college, I have the plan to transfer to Seattle University and keep study on computer science to achieve a <strong>Bachelor's degree</strong>. In this quarter, I also study Computer Science class which is about the Java language.</p>
        <p>My plan is to complete all three Web Authoring classes at Seattle Central College which will help me to support my parent's company. <em>My first major in college was Business but after studied in 3 quarters, I changed it to Computer Science.</em> In summer 2018, I started to learn to make static web by my self used w3schools website before I changed my major. After finish all the Web Authoring class, I hope I can develop my parent's company website.</p>
